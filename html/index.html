  <head><title>Unisquatting - Typosquatting with Unicode</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>You got phished.</h1>
   
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    The hyperlink you clicked on contained a unicode character.  Several unicode characters can look very similar, if not identical, to their ASCII cousins.<br />  
    For instance, 'w' vs. 'ᴡ'.  Can you tell the difference?  Maybe with the right font (such as the default font on this web page.)<br />  
    Could you tell the difference when this pops up in a tooltip in your email client, or Teams chat, or Discord community, as part of a domain name with an otherwise legitimate-looking URL?<br />
    <br />
    <b>Example:</b><br />
    Legitimate: https://walmart.com/shop/deals<br />
    Unisquatted: https://ᴡalmart.com/shop/deals<br />
    <br />
    That's pretty tough.<br />
   
    <h2>How?</h2>
    Domain names can be registered with Unicode characters in them, such as Cyrillic or even your favorite emojis.<br />
    In order to translate those characters into ASCII, a domain name is generated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">Punycode</a>, which is a method of representing Unicode characters within an ASCII domain name.<br />
    What you're actually registering, in this case, is an ASCII domain name that represents a Unicode character.  In the case of my domain, ᴡalmart.com, it's actually represented in Punycode as xn--almart-245b.com.<br />
    Modern web browsers will now display the Punycode in the URL bar instead of the Unicode characters in an effort to tip users off.<br />
    However, modern operating systems still display the Unicode characters in a domain name in a tooltip, which most security-conscious users will look at to observe if the URL they're about to click is legitimate.<br />
    In this case, a user still has no realistic indication the domain they're about to go to isn't legitimate without performing additional investigation, which they'd have no real reason to do.<br />
    In reality, a user won't realize something is wrong until AFTER the click, and even then only if they're paying close attention to their browser.<br />

    <h2>What's the fix?</h2>
    Unsure, but I'm not that smart.  My guess is that operating system UX elements displaying a URL should display the Punycode instead of the Unicode, or provide some visual indicator that the domain name contains a Unicode characer.<br />
    In my opinion, this is still a problem.

    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/economycomfort/unisquat">Github repo</a> that contains this HTML and other pieces of information I've gathered on the topic of domain squatting with unicode (also called an <a href=")https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">IDN Homograph Attack</a>, but I think "unisquatting" sounds better.)
    
    <h2>Hosting</h2>
    This page is hosted via <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a> fed by the GitHub repo above.  From there, a domain with a unicode character is placed in front of it.<br/>

    This received some press in 2017 from a researcher named Xudong Zheng, who <a href="https://www.xudongz.com/blog/2017/idn-phishing/">published a rather comprehensive writeup on the subject</a>.<br />
