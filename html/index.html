    <h1>You got phished.</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    The hyperlink you clicked on contained a unicode character.  Several unicode characters can look very similar, if not identical, to their ASCII cousins.<br />  
    For instance, 'w' vs. 'ᴡ'.  Can you tell the difference?  Maybe with the right font (such as the default font on this web page.)<br />  
    Could you tell the difference when this pops up in a tooltip in your email client, or Teams chat, or Discord community, as part of a domain name with an otherwise legitimate-looking URL?<br />
    <br />
    <b>Example:</b>
    https://ᴡalmart.com/<br />
    <br />
    That's pretty tough.
